The Library Data Analysis project demonstrates how data science techniques can be applied to understand reading patterns, borrowing behavior, and resource utilization within a college library. By analyzing structured datasets, we identified key trends such as the most preferred book categories, peak borrowing periods, and student reading preferences.

The analysis helped uncover meaningful insights, including:

Most frequently borrowed book types

Popular genres among students

Borrowing frequency trends

User preferences for reading formats

Using Python libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib, we performed data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and interpretation. These tools enabled us to convert raw library records into actionable insights.

This project highlights the importance of data-driven decision-making in library management. The insights gained can help administrators:

Optimize book inventory

Improve resource allocation

Enhance student engagement

Plan future acquisitions based on demand
